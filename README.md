# Introduction
An implementation of the traditional 9x9 Sudoku game in Python 3 and Pygame.

My code acheives the following - 
* Randomly generating a solvable Sudoku puzzle
* Adjustment of difficulty level based on user's choice (Easy, Medium, Difficult)
* Timer logs the time taken to finish
* Check for validity of last entry
* Clean efficient UI with smooth performance

The code prints out the solution on the terminal for reference.

All back buttons take you one step back. The reload takes you to the main menu. Also - after you finish, an end screen congratulates you and offers a choice between exit and another game.

# Indications
1. First download the compressed directory from here and extract it.
1. To run the code - cd into the the Sudoku-master directory, then
1. Enter `python main.py` in the terminal

# Requirements
These files must all be in the same directory, and there should be an installation of Python 3 and Pygame 1.9 on the system.
