# PYGAME-SUDOKU
Sudoku game in Pygame 1.9, code in Python 2.7
This game was actually a team project, but I have added only my part of the deal.
I had to write a function to take a display surface as an argument and write on it. 

My code acheives the following - 
* Randomly generating a solvable Sudoku puzzle
* Adjustment of difficulty level based on user's choice (Easy, Medium, Difficult)
* Timer logs the time taken to finish
* Check for validity of last entry
* Clean efficient UI with smooth performance

The code prints out the solution on the terminal for reference.

All back buttons take you one step back. The reload takes you to the main menu. Also - after you finish, an end screen congratulates you and offers a choice between exit and another game.

# INDICATIONS - 
1. First download the compressed directory from here and extract it.
1. To run the code - cd into the the Sudoku-master directory, then
1. type `python main.py` into your terminal

# REQUIREMENTS
You have to have these files in the same directory, and Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9 installed on your system.
There are only one or two places where I have used commands that are not allowed in Python3. Those may be changed to Python3 alternatives easily.
