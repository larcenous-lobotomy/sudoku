# PYGAME-SUDOKU
Sudoku game in Pygame 1.9, code in Python 2.7
This game was actually a team project, but I have added only my part of the deal.
I had to write a function to take a display surface as an argument and write on it. 

My code acheives the following - 
* Randomly generating a solvable Sudoku puzzle
* Adjustment of difficulty level based on user's choice (Easy, Medium, Difficult)
* Timer logs the time taken to finish
* Check for validity last entry
* Clean efficient UI with smooth performance

My code has options for easy, medium and hard level, a timer, an evaluate button (which works only after you have filled in all 
                                                                                  cells), and mouseclick selection and
                                                                                  num-key based input.
The code prints out the solution on the terminal for reference.

All back buttons take you one step back. The reload takes you to the main menu.

INDICATIONS - 
First download the zipped directory and unzip it.
To run the code - cd into the the Sudoku-master directory, then
type this into your terminal -> python main.py

NOTE - You have to have these files in the same directory, and python 2.7 and pygame 1.9 installed on your system.
        I think there is only one or two places where I have used commands that are not allowed in python3. Those can be changed to python3 alternatives easily.
